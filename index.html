        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Alex Wagner. I'm a software engineer with a passion for building things that people love to use. I'm on track to graduate with my B.S. in Computer Science this October and am looking for a full-time role where I can make a real impact. My main area of expertise is Android development with Kotlin, where I've spent countless hours building a complex, production-ready application from scratch. But my curiosity doesn't stop there; I'm also proficient in C++, Java, Python, and C#. When I'm not coding, you can usually find me developing indie games—a hobby that constantly pushes my creativity and technical skills. I love a good challenge and am excited to bring my blend of experience to an innovative team. Please explore my work below.</p>

   <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! I'm Alex Wagner, a passionate and dedicated computer science student with a focus on software engineering and game development. I have experience in several programming languages, including C++, Java, Python, and C#. I enjoy exploring different areas of computer science, and game development is a personal hobby of mine.</p>
  
  <p>Throughout my studies, I have built strong problem-solving skills, learned how to develop both software and games, and gained experience in web development using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love working on projects that challenge me and push the limits of my creativity and technical skills.</p>

  <p>I’m currently pursuing opportunities as a software developer or video game developer, and I’m excited to contribute to innovative projects. Feel free to check out my projects below or get in touch!</p>

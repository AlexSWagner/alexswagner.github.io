    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Alex Wagner — a software developer from York, Pennsylvania, with a deep passion for both building software and understanding the machines that run it.</p>
    
    <p>I'm currently finishing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University, and I’m set to graduate in October 2025. My main focus is Android development using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. I’ve independently built a full-featured audiobook player called <strong>XelaBooks</strong>, which supports metadata enrichment, cloud sync, and advanced playback customization. This project represents hundreds of hours of hands-on work and reflects my dedication to creating polished, user-friendly applications with clean architecture and maintainable code.</p>
    
    <p>I have experience across the entire software development lifecycle — from planning and implementation to testing, deployment, and maintenance. My technical toolkit includes Kotlin, C++, C#, Java, and Python, and I’ve developed everything from real-time PC monitoring tools in C# to secure folder encryption software in Python. I enjoy working across the stack and have experience with frameworks like .NET Core, ASP.NET, and Firebase.</p>
    
    <p>My passion for technology started with a lifelong curiosity about how video games work. That interest led me to build my first PC, dive into modding, and explore the technical side of how software functions. It introduced me to the idea that I could change, break, or improve the things I used, and that hands-on experience was the beginning of my journey into development.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of that, I’m also a hobbyist indie game developer. I’ve spent years creating gameplay systems, combat mechanics, and quest logic in Unity using C#. Game development continues to challenge and inspire me creatively and technically.</p>
    
    <p>Right now, I’m looking for a full-time opportunity where I can grow as a developer, contribute to impactful software, and collaborate with a team that values thoughtful design and great user experiences. Whether it’s in mobile, web, or game development, I’m excited to help build something people truly enjoy using.</p>

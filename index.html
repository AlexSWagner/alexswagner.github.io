        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I've been fascinated by computers and video games for as long as I can remember. That childhood curiosity eventually led me to game modding. I wanted to tweak and customize the games I loved, which meant I had to learn how to code. What started as figuring out how to modify a few game files turned into a self-taught coding journey, and once I had a solid programming foundation, my fascination only grew stronger. Suddenly, the possibilities felt endless.</p>
        <p>I'm Alex, a software developer who genuinely loves what I do. Whether I'm building Android apps in Kotlin, creating gameplay systems in Unity, or putting together Windows utilities in C++, I'm always thinking about the same things: clean code, smooth performance, and creating something people will actually enjoy using. I recently launched my first app on the Google Play Store called Audiobook Buddy — an audiobook player for Android, and seeing people download and use something I built was an incredible feeling.</p>
        <p>I'm wrapping up my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a Software Engineering concentration (graduating October 2025), but honestly, most of my learning happens when I'm experimenting with new frameworks and languages in my free time. I've worked across the full development lifecycle on everything from full-stack web apps to Unity games to production Android apps, and I'm currently diving into Unreal Engine and Blueprints to level up my game dev skills.</p>
        <p>My toolkit includes Kotlin, C#, C++, Java, and Python, plus frameworks like Jetpack Compose, Room, Firebase, .NET Core, and Unity. But more than any specific technology, what drives me is the challenge of turning an idea into something real — something functional, polished, and enjoyable to use.</p>
        <p>I'm looking for a remote role where I can join an experienced engineering team, contribute to meaningful projects, and keep growing as a developer in mobile, web, or game development. If you're looking for someone who's passionate about the craft and excited to build great software, let's talk.</p>

                    <h3>Audiobook Buddy</h3>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Audiobook Buddy</strong> is an officially released Android audiobook player now available on the Play Store. I designed, developed, and launched the app entirely on my own — from concept through production — implementing a scalable architecture and advanced metadata system to deliver a polished experience for audiobook enthusiasts.</p>

                <h4>Technical Overview:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>My signature metadata enhancement algorithm queries multiple APIs to automatically populate missing cover art and book descriptions. Firebase Cloud Functions handle metadata caching, allowing the app to scale efficiently while avoiding API rate limits.</li>
                    <li>Integrates Google Drive, Dropbox, and Microsoft OneDrive APIs for secure cloud imports that comply with Play Store data safety and OAuth guidelines.</li>
                    <li>Connects to the Internet Archive API to provide access to public domain audiobooks, enabling users to browse and download by category or subject directly within the app.</li>
                    <li>Supports optional cloud sync and backup via Firebase Authentication and Firestore, storing listening progress, library structure, and bookmarks securely.</li>
                    <li>Built entirely with Jetpack Compose and ExoPlayer for a modern, responsive UI and a full-featured playback experience with background playback support, bookmarking, and 12 handcrafted themes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Architecture & Tech Stack:</h4>
                <p>Structured around a clean <strong>MVVM architecture</strong> with reactive data flow, dependency injection using <strong>Hilt</strong>, asynchronous operations via <strong>Coroutines</strong> and <strong>StateFlow</strong>, and persistence through <strong>Room</strong>. The design prioritizes modularity, testability, and maintainability for long-term scalability.</p>
                <div class="tech-stack"><strong>Technologies:</strong> Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Material 3, Hilt, Coroutines, StateFlow, Room, Retrofit, Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions), ExoPlayer, Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive APIs.</div>

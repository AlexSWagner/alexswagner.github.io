    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Alex Wagner, a software engineer from York, Pennsylvania, currently completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University (expected October 2025, GPA 3.6). I specialize in creating high-quality Android applications, performance-focused desktop utilities, and engaging game experiences, with expertise in Kotlin, C#, C++, Java, and Python.</p>

    <p>My work emphasizes clean architecture, maintainable code, and user-centered design. I’m experienced across the entire software development lifecycle, from concept and architecture to deployment and long-term maintenance. My technical background includes frameworks and tools such as Jetpack Compose, .NET Core, ASP.NET, Firebase, and modern development practices like MVVM architecture, dependency injection, and asynchronous programming.</p>

    <p>Beyond mobile and desktop development, I’m an active indie game developer. I have built gameplay systems, combat mechanics, and quest logic in Unity using C#, and I’m currently expanding my skill set by learning Unreal Engine and Blueprints. This mix of technical and creative work keeps me adaptable and ready to tackle complex challenges.</p>

    <p>I’m seeking a full-time remote role where I can apply my skills to impactful software projects, collaborate with a talented team, and continue growing as a developer. Whether in mobile, web, or game development, I’m committed to delivering reliable, scalable, and user-focused solutions.</p>

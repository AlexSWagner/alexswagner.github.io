    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Alex Wagner, a software engineer from York, Pennsylvania, completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering at Southern New Hampshire University (expected October 2025, GPA 3.6).</p>
    
    <p>My expertise spans Android development, desktop utilities, and game development. I’m proficient in Kotlin, C#, C++, Java, and Python, with experience in frameworks like Jetpack Compose, .NET Core, ASP.NET, and Firebase.</p>
    
    <p>My flagship project, <strong>XelaBooks</strong>, is a production-quality Android audiobook player built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It features metadata enrichment, cloud sync, and advanced playback customization using a clean MVVM architecture.</p>
    
    <p>I’ve also developed open-source tools including a secure AES-based folder encryption utility in Python and a real-time PC performance monitor in C#. These projects reflect my focus on clean code, scalability, and user-centered design.</p>
    
    <p>I’m currently seeking a full-time remote role where I can contribute to impactful software projects in mobile, web, or game development, and continue growing my technical expertise while delivering real value to users.</p>
